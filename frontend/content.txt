THE MAIN ARTICON RULE – “One Icon to Rule Them All!”
You must successfully complete all 3 category tasks before the event timer ends  (9:00 AM – 7:30 PM).


Each task will follow the same central theme, revealed on the event day.


You can start with your primary category, then move to the other two once your first is submitted.


Integration matters! Using a connected idea, story, or brand concept across all three gives you an edge.


You’ll be judged on creativity, consistency, storytelling, and time mastery.


Only those who complete all 3 will be eligible for the Main ArtIcon Trophy & Title.

Before you grab your sketchpads & styles… ek baar rulebook scroll kar lo, Creators! 

1. Participation Format
ArtIcon 2025 is strictly a solo competition. No teams, no taglines, and no “mera dost bhi karega” excuses. Every participant must register individually and work independently during the event. (Collab karna mana hai boss… ye hai solo creative showdown!)
2. Category Selection
Choose your battlefield wisely; you can pick only one main category while registering:
 • UI/UX Design – Balance aesthetics and usability like a pro.
 • Video Editing – Tell stories with cuts, effects, and vibes.
 • Graphic Design – Let visuals do all the talking.
 (Choose your weapon, designer. Ek hi zindagi, Ek hi category )
3. Use of AI Tools
AI ka use allowed hai, par pura kaam usi se karwa liya toh trophy ka sapna “404 Not Found” ho jaayega. The final work must show your own creative direction and originality. Fully AI-generated pieces will be disqualified. (AI ko assistant banao, artist ko hero rehne do)
4. Equipment & Materials
Bring your own laptop, device, charger, and software. Basically, everything that makes your design life complete. Internet and power points will be available at the venue, but ensuring your tools work smoothly before the event is your responsibility. (Event ke din “update ho raha hai” likha mila toh… RIP productivity)
5. Submission Guidelines
The theme and tasks will be revealed on the spot at the event start. Detailed submission and file upload instructions will be emailed once you’re shortlisted. All entries must be submitted by 5:00 PM sharp. Late submissions will not be accepted. (Art bhi punctual hona chahiye, warna deadline khud artist ban jaayegi)
6. Reporting & Attendance
Participants must report by 8:30 AM for check-in and setup. Latecomers after 9:00 AM can enter but will not get extra time. (Hero entry ke liye delay allowed hai, par timer rukta nahi re baba)

7. Judging Criteria
Your creation will be judged on:
 • Creativity and originality
 • Concept clarity and theme alignment
 • Technical execution
 • Smart use of AI
 • Storytelling and presentation
The jury’s decision will be final. Re-evaluation requests will not be entertained. (Ye koi viva nahi hai )
