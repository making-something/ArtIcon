Rules & Regulations Belt
Manual for the Makers & Masterminds!
“Before you dive into innovation, read the script, Picasso!” 
Solo participation only (kyunki asli genius akela hi chamakta hai!)


Use of AI tools is encouraged but not a substitute for real creativity!



THE MAIN ARTICON RULE – “One Icon to Rule Them All!”
You must successfully complete all 3 category tasks before the event timer ends  (9:00 AM – 7:30 PM).


Each task will follow the same central theme, revealed on the event day.


You can start with your primary category, then move to the other two once your first is submitted.


Integration matters! Using a connected idea, story, or brand concept across all three gives you an edge.


You’ll be judged on creativity, consistency, storytelling, and time mastery.


Only those who complete all 3 will be eligible for the Main ArtIcon Trophy & Title.
